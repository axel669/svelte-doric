# Svelte

## Benefits
- updates are fast
- precompiled (no cdn required)
- support for custom events without issue
- enforcing making more components for nested styling means cleaner CSS
    at each level
- Much less code to describe how components and data are connected

## Downsides
- 2 way data binding mixed with unidirectional flow can be confusing at first
- more rules added than react
    - css variables are a done in a different way than things like
        styled-components
    - different way of thinking about moving events and data means some
        retraining
    - forcing smaller components for css is also a big change in thinking
- no framework for material-ui levels of elements
